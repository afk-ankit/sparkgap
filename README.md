# Sparkgap âš¡

A production-ready Circuit Breaker for Go with built-in jittered backoff strategies. Designed to make your services resilient, fault-tolerant, and herd-resistant when facing downstream failures.

## About the Project

**Sparkgap** is designed to protect your services from failures in downstream dependencies. By implementing jittered backoff strategies and robust circuit breaking mechanisms, it enhances the resilience and fault-tolerance of your applications. Whether you are building microservices or large-scale distributed systems, sparkgap helps ensure stability and reliability in the face of unpredictable failures.

> âš¡ This is a very initial stage project. Keep watching, things are about to get electrifying!
